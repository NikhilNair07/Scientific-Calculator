# Project Title: Simple Calculator

## Overview:

The Simple Calculator project is a C++ program that provides a user-friendly command-line interface for performing various mathematical operations. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), calculate factorial, raise a number to a power, find the square, square root, cube, and cube root of a number, as well as calculate percentages. The program offers a menu-driven interface, making it easy for users to select the desired operation.<br>

## Features:

1. Addition: Allows users to add two numbers and displays the result.<br>
2. Subtraction: Enables users to subtract one number from another and displays the result.<br>
3. Multiplication: Allows users to multiply two numbers and displays the product.<br>
4. Division: Enables users to divide one number by another and displays the quotient.<br>
5. Factorial: Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer input.<br>
6. Power: Raises the first input number to the power of the second input number.<br>
7. Square: Calculates the square of a given number.<br>
8. Square Root: Computes the square root of a given number.<br>
9. Cube: Calculates the cube of a given number.<br>
10. Cube Root: Computes the cube root of a given number.<br>
11. Percentage: Calculates the percentage of the first input number with respect to the second input number.<br>

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
2. Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler.<br>
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the desired operation and provide necessary input.<br>
